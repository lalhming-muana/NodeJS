/** 
In Node.js, a callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the first function completes. The callback abstraction allows for non-blocking, event-driven programming, which is well-suited to building highly concurrent applications. This is because a callback function is called only after an event has occurred, such as a file being read or a network request completing, rather than waiting for the event to occur before continuing execution. This approach allows Node.js to handle multiple events simultaneously and improves the performance of the application.
